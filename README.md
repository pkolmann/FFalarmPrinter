Florian 10 WASTL alarm printer

We used to have a perl program, fetching the data from Florian 10 WASTL interface and create a nice HTML page to print.

I now want to redo this work in java to have it available for Windows and Linux.

I have this here on GitHub so others can use this too.

<b>!!!! WARNING !!!</b>

This is my first Java project, so things are not perfect. Please don't be too hard with your critism.
